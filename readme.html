This is the readme for the models associated with the paper

Lee, Jin (2007) "Fast Rhythmic Bursting
Cells: The Horizontal Fiber System in the Cat`s Primary Visual
Cortex" Penn McNair Research Journal: Vol. 1: Iss. 1, Article 1

These NEURON models (NEURON is available from http://www.neuron.yale.edu)
can be autolaunched from ModelDB to immediately start a simulation or download and extract
the archive, compile the mod files and then under

unix/linux:
-----------
type 
nrngui mosinit.hoc
at the command line

mac os X:
---------
drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon

mswin:
------
double click the mosinit.hoc file in the extracted folder

after the simulation starts:
----------------------------
First select a cell from the menu, for example FRB.
The morphologies of this model match those shown in figure 3C of the paper.

Press the "Init & Run" button.

When the simulation is complete you should see a figure like:

February 22nd, 2010: These files were updated to include data files so that
the additional FRB_12_19 and FRB_12_21 simulations can be run.
